# Getting Started with FlowK

This guide will walk you through installing FlowK, configuring your environment, and running your first flow.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- **Go**: Version 1.21 or higher.
- **Make**: (Optional) for using Makefile shortcuts.

### Building from Source

Clone the repository and build the binary:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flowk.git
cd flowk
go build -o ./bin/flowk ./cmd/flowk/main.go
```

Verify the installation:

```bash
./bin/flowk -version
```

## Running FlowK

FlowK has two primary modes of operation: **CLI Mode** (headless) and **UI Mode** (server).

### CLI Mode (Headless)

Useful for CI/CD pipelines or scripting where no visual interface is needed.

```bash
./bin/flowk run -flow ./path/to/your/flow.json
```

**Common Flags:**
- `-flow <path>`: Path to the JSON flow definition file (required).
- `-validate-only`: Validates the flow schema and imports without executing tasks.
- `-config <path>`: Path to a custom `config.yaml` file.
- `-vars`: Pass dynamic variables (e.g., `-vars "env=prod,retries=3"`).

### UI Mode (Visual)

Starts a local web server to visualize the flow execution in real-time.

```bash
./bin/flowk run -serve-ui -flow ./path/to/your/flow.json
```

Access the UI at: `http://localhost:8080` (default)

## Configuration

FlowK looks for a configuration file in the following order:
1. Path specified by `-config` flag.
2. `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/flowk/config.yaml`
3. Default values if no file is found.

### Example `config.yaml`

```yaml
ui:
  host: "0.0.0.0"
  port: 8080
  dir: "ui/dist" # Path to built UI assets

secrets:
  provider: "vault" # "none" or "vault"
  vault:
    address: "https://vault.example.local"
    token: "s.xxxxx" # Recommended: inject from environment or external secret manager
    kv_mount: "kv"   # Optional, defaults to kv
    kv_prefix: ""    # Optional path prefix
```

### Native Vault placeholders

When `secrets.provider` is `vault`, FlowK can resolve placeholders in task payloads:

- `${secret:vault:<path>#<field>}`

Example:

- `${secret:vault:apps/demo#api_token}`

The placeholder resolves at runtime before action execution.

Notes:
- `secrets.provider` defaults to `none` (backward compatible mode).
- If `secrets.provider: vault`, then `secrets.vault.address` and `secrets.vault.token` are required.
- `secrets.vault.kv_mount` and `secrets.vault.kv_prefix` are optional and help map logical paths to your KV v2 mount.

- Check out the [UI Guide](./ui-guide.md) to master the visual interface.
