## Overview

**FlowK** is a powerful automation engine designed to simplify complex workflows without writing a single line of imperative code. **The philosophy is simple: usage of 100% JSON-defined flows.**

While you can write these flows by hand, FlowK is architected to be **LLM-Native**. The ultimate goal is for an AI to generate the entire flow for you. By exposing a comprehensive, self-generated context guide, FlowK empowers Large Language Models to act as your autonomous DevOps & QA engineers, creating complex, deterministic automations from high-level instructions.

Whether you are running local dev setups, CI/CD pipelines, or **complex end-to-end integration tests**, FlowK provides a reliable runtime for your AI-generated tasks.

### Key Features

- **No-Code / JSON-Only**: Define 100% of your infrastructure and logic in schema-validated JSON. No scripts required.
- **Composable Architecture**: Nest flows within flows (`subflows`) to encourage reuse and modularity.
- **Parallel Execution**: Native support for parallel tasks to speed up independent operations.
- **Rich Action Ecosystem**: Built-in support for HTTP requests, Docker, Kubernetes, Database (MySQL, Postgres), SSH, and more.
- **Native HashiCorp Vault Integration**: Resolve `${secret:vault:...}` placeholders at runtime and manage KV v2 with `SECRET_PROVIDER_VAULT` (`HEALTH`, `KV_PUT`, `KV_GET`, `KV_LIST`, `KV_DELETE`) without external Vault CLI calls.
- **Interactive UI**: An optional web interface to visualize flow execution, inspect task details, and view real-time logs.
- **Resilient**: Features like `on_error_flow` and `finally_flow` ensure robust error handling and resource cleanup.
- **AI-Ready**: Designed for LLM-assisted workflows. Download the full action schema and context to let AI generate flows for you.

### Why FlowK

- **Single binary runtime** that runs locally or in CI without external orchestration services.
- **Schema-validated JSON flows** for deterministic, reproducible automation.
- **Built-in integrations** for infrastructure, testing, and operational workflows.
- **Developer-friendly UI** for fast debugging and execution visibility.
- **Self-sufficient**: the application runs without requiring external apps or services.

## Quick Start

### 1. Download (Recommended)

Get the latest prebuilt binaries from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/jmmsegovia/flowk/releases).

Download the archive for your OS/architecture and run the `flowk` binary inside.

### 2. Run a Flow
```bash
# Execute a flow and see logs in your terminal
./flowk run -flow ./flows/print/loop_without_for.json
```

There are 50+ example flows under `flows/`. Some examples require external services; to run them all, you’ll need additional dependencies such as Docker Desktop with Kubernetes enabled.

### 3. Launch the UI
```bash
# Start the UI server to visualize execution
./flowk run -serve-ui

# Then import and run the flow from
./flows/print/loop_without_for.json
```
_Open your browser at `http://localhost:8080` (default port)_

## HashiCorp Vault Integration (End-to-End)

FlowK includes complete Vault support in two layers:

- **Runtime secret resolution**: enable `secrets.provider: vault` in config and use `${secret:vault:<path>#<field>}` placeholders in any task payload.
- **Native Vault operations**: use `SECRET_PROVIDER_VAULT` for KV v2 lifecycle operations (`HEALTH`, `KV_PUT`, `KV_GET`, `KV_LIST`, `KV_DELETE`).
- **Runnable E2E demo**: sample flow starts Vault in Docker, writes/reads/lists/deletes KV secrets, validates placeholder resolution, then cleans up the container.

Minimal config:

```yaml
secrets:
  provider: vault
  vault:
    address: http://127.0.0.1:8200
    token: root
    kv_mount: secret
```

Example placeholder:

```json
"Authorization": "Bearer ${secret:vault:apps/demo#api_token}"
```

Validate and run the full Docker-based integration demo:

```bash
./flowk run -flow flows/test/variables/vault_docker_provider_demo/vault_docker_provider_demo.json -config flows/test/variables/vault_docker_provider_demo/config.vault.dev.yaml -validate-only
./flowk run -flow flows/test/variables/vault_docker_provider_demo/vault_docker_provider_demo.json -config flows/test/variables/vault_docker_provider_demo/config.vault.dev.yaml
```

### Build (Optional)

If you prefer to compile locally:

```bash
go build -o ./bin/flowk ./cmd/flowk/main.go
```

Requires Go 1.24.3 or newer.
